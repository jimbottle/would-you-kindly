# Changelog

All notable changes to this project are documented in this file. The
format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/),
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [Unreleased]

### Added

- **Human-in-the-loop contract** (`docs/CONTRACT.md`): tasks carry the
  `human` label, the description holds the runbook, and a
  `src:agent` / `src:human` label distinguishes who filed the work.
- **Bubble Tea TUI** (`cmd/wyk`) over bd, with vim-style navigation
  (`j`/`k`/`g`/`G`), `enter` to expand an issue and read its
  instructions, `esc` to return, `/` for a fuzzy title+body filter,
  `h` to jump directly to the human-flagged view, `tab` to cycle
  through preset filters (`all`/`ready`/`human`/`mine`/`blocked`),
  `r` to refresh, and a status bar showing the active preset, counts,
  and last-sync time.
- **bd CLI client** (`internal/beads`) that shells out to `bd` and
  parses its JSON, tolerating unknown fields for forward compatibility,
  with typed errors for the two common failure modes (bd not installed,
  no `.beads` workspace).
- **Periodic refresh** every 10 seconds — no filesystem-watcher
  dependency.
- **Non-TTY probe mode** (`wyk --probe`) for scripts and CI: prints
  human-flagged issues and exits with a meaningful status code.

### Out of scope (deferred to Phase 2+)

- Write actions in the TUI (create, close, update, label, comment).
- A `wyk init` command to bind the tool to a repo.
- Post-commit hooks.
- The agent-side skill that sets the `human` label on handoff.
- Any background daemon.
